# Inflight Statuses

# Description

These are small, lightweight status pages which (depending on the capabilities of an airline's wifi system) will show realtime position, altitude, and flight information. Depending on the airline, a map may be included.

## Supported Airlines

Currently, Alaska Airlines (ASA), Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), and British Airways (BAW) are supported.

I will add more airlines as I fly them/am able to make use of exposed endpoints in their IFE.

# Use

To use, you'll need to clone the repository or at least download the folder corresponding to the airline you will be flying before you take off, unless you pay for wifi.

After connecting to the plane's wifi network, open the index.html page corresponding to the airline you are flying.

American Airlines: AAL/index.html
Delta Airlines: DAL/index.html
Alaska Airlines: ASA/index.html
United Airlines: UAL/index.html
British Airways: BAW/index.html
